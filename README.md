# Perennial

Perennial creates a variable audio film from your local video and audio files.
It’s not just a loop. Perennial assigns multiple audio tracks to each scene so that every iteration has different audio. The tracks submitted are permuted and shuffled mkaing every an entirely new sequence.
The Math: If there are 7 one minute scenes with 5 audio possibilities each:
7 x 5!(5−5)! = 7 x 120 = 840 minutes
That’s 14 hours of different combinations.
